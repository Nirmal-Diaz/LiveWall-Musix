      "So it stood ninety years on the floor",
      "It was taller by half than the old man himself",
      "Though it weighed not a pennyweight more",
      "It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born",
      "And was always his treasure and pride",
      "But it stopped short never to go again",
      "When the old man died"

      "In watching its pendulum swing to and fro",
      "many hours he spent as a boy.",
      "And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know",
      "and to share both his grief and his joy",
      "for it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door",
      "with a blooming and beautiful bride",

      "My grandfather said that of those he could hire",
      "Not a servant so faithful he found",
      "For it wasted no time, and had but one desire",
      "At the close of each week to be wound",
      "And it kept in its place not a frown upon its face",
